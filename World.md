# Narrative Design & World Building

## 👥 Character Arcs (The Shelters)
The story is told through the voices of those you choose to save:
* **Shelter Alpha (The Pragmatists):** A group of scientists with high survival chances but a cold, clinical outlook.
* **Shelter Beta (The Family):** High emotional stakes and low survival skills; they provide the emotional "heart" of the radio logs.
* **The Operator:** Your own story is revealed in fragments through outgoing transmissions.

## 🌿 Branching Logic & Outcomes
The game tracks your decisions to reach one of three primary states:
* **Outcome A (The Beacon):** You sacrifice your own heat and safety to keep every shelter alive for one final night.
* **Outcome B (The Lone Wolf):** You cut off all communications to prioritize your own rescue.
* **Outcome C (The Static):** You fail to manage the resource web, and the mountain goes silent before rescue arrives.

## ❄️ The Whiteout
The primary antagonist is the environment. The "Whiteout" serves as both a literal storm and a narrative metaphor for the encroaching silence and isolation.
