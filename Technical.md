# Technical Design & Balance

## ⚖️ Balance Variables
* **Power Decay Rate:** A variable that increases over time to simulate the worsening "Whiteout" storm.
* **Desperation Meter:** A hidden narrative trigger that activates when a shelter has been "in the dark" for too long, leading to more frantic and disturbing audio logs.
* **Shelter Stability Index:** A cumulative score for each node that tracks their survival probability based on the resources and power provided by the operator.

## 🛠️ UI Architecture
* **Tactile Interface:** Designed to simulate analog machinery. 
* **Signal Degradation Logic:** A system that procedurally distorts text and audio files based on the current Power Allocation to that specific node.

## 📅 Development Roadmap
* **Phase 1:** Core Radio Map UI prototype and node interaction.
* **Phase 2:** Integration of the Power Allocation system and basic signal degradation.
* **Phase 3:** Narrative branching and "Stability Index" implementation.
