# The Last Broadcast 📻❄️

**The Last Broadcast** is a high-tension narrative management game where the player assumes the role of a lone Radio Operator atop a frozen mountain. As the world ends in a "Whiteout," you must manage a limited power supply to bridge connections between scattered survivor shelters, making life-or-death decisions about whose voice gets heard and whose goes silent.

## 📡 Design Pillars
* **The Weight of Silence:** Every choice to help one group is a choice to ignore another. Silence is the primary fail state and emotional driver.
* **Tactile Isolation:** The UI is designed to feel like old, cold machinery—utilizing knobs, dials, and static to immerse the player.
* **Consequential Narrative:** There are no "right" answers; only difficult trade-offs that lead to divergent ending states.

## 🛠️ Technical Overview
* **Platform:** PC (Mouse & Keyboard focused).
* **Genre:** Management Thriller / Narrative Sim.
* **Core Loop:** Monitor Signal Nodes → Allocate Power → Broker Information → Manage Shelter Stability.

## 🎭 Portfolio Highlight: "The Management Thriller"
This project focuses on **Negative Space** in design—emphasizing that what the player chooses *not* to do is as important as their active decisions. It demonstrates the integration of a math-based resource system (Power) directly into narrative branching.
