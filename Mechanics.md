# Gameplay Systems & Mechanics

## 1. The Radio Map (Core UI)
The game is played entirely through a top-down interface representing the mountain range.
* **Node System:** Survivor shelters appear as individual signal nodes on the map.
* **Signal Strength:** Represented by the visual clarity of the node. Low signal results in garbled text or audio.
* **Power Allocation:** Players interact with a global "Power Meter" by dragging power bars from the station to specific nodes.

## 2. The Resource Web
Helping a shelter is a physical redirection of resources rather than a simple click:
* **The Heater Dilemma:** Sending a high-frequency burst to stabilize one shelter's heater might "blow a fuse," cutting off another shelter for several minutes.
* **Information Brokering:** Players must act as a bridge between shelters with different needs (e.g., linking a shelter with medicine to one with food).
* **Tower Survival:** The operator must decide when to prioritize the signal web versus the survival of their own tower.

## 3. Power Management
* **Limited Supply:** There is never enough power to keep every shelter active simultaneously.
* **Power Decay:** As the storm worsens, the total power pool shrinks, forcing increasingly desperate choices.
